## Armor

Alloy plating
  - made of advanced metal alloys engineered for high resistance to attacks at relatively low weights
  - Hardness: 20.
  - Tactical Speed Penalty: –500 feet (–1 square).
  - Weight: One-eighth the weight of the starship (rounded down).


## Defense

- Autopilot System
  - provides a +5 equipment bonus to the starship’s Defense 
  - applies only when the autopilot system is engaged
- Damage control
  - regains an additional +1d10 points of damage each time damage control is performed successfully
  - Restriction: Licensed (+1).
- Point-defense System
  - targets all incoming missiles
  - allows a starship to make attacks of opportunity against enemy ships passing through its threatened area (the space it occupies as well as all adjacent 500-foot squares)
  - consists of batteries of automated weapons programmed to fire when either of these two conditions is met.
  - does not fire upon mines
  - cannot be controlled manually by the crew
  - cannot be used to make normal attacks
  - has a 20% chance of destroying any incoming missile
  - When making an attack of opportunity, the point-defense system rolls 1d20 and adds the ship’s targeting system bonus on the roll. If the result equals or exceeds the enemy ship’s Defense, the point-defense weapons deal ballistic damage based on the ship’s type, as shown in Table: Point-Defense Systems. 
  - Point-defense systems cannot score critical hits
  - Restriction: Licensed (+1).
- Radiation shielding
  - protects a ship’s crew and passengers against the harmful radiation of neutron stars, solar flares, and other external causes
  - All personnel aboard the ship gain a +5 circumstance bonus on saves to resist the effects of radiation poisoning
- Sensor jammer
  - interferes with radar and enemy sensor scans. 
  - Confounds missile guidance systems
  - Sensor checks made against a ship with an active sensor jammer take a –5 penalty
  - ship gains one-half concealment against missile attacks (20% miss chance).
  - Any ship with a Class III sensor system (or better) is not subject to the effects of the sensor jammer, ignoring the penalty and miss chance


## Sensors

- Class II sensor array
  - hi-res video, infrared and electromagnetic sensors, and ladar detection units
  - can perform any one of the following functions with a successful Computer Use check (DC 15):
    - Ascertain, Identify, Analyze
    - the location, type (ultralight, light, and so on), and subtype (fighter, destroyer, and so on) of all visible ships on the battlefield
    - the location of all visible hazards on the battlefield (such as asteroids and mines).
    - all PL 5 or PL 6 weapons on a specific ship (number and type of weapons present), including their organization into batteries (but not fire links).
    - the presence of any or all of the following systems on a specific ship: 
      - grapplers, 
      - magnetic field, 
      - point-defense system.
    - Identify a specific ship’s armor type (PL 5 and PL 6 armor types only).
    - Analyze the chemical composition of a planet’s atmosphere (the ship must be orbiting the planet).
- Targeting system
  - helps starship gunners aim weapons and track enemy ships
  - provides an equipment bonus on attack rolls depending on the ship’s size: Huge +1, Gargantuan +2, Colossal +3.

## Communications

- Laser transceiver
  - uses a beam of coherent light to transmit messages
  - unidirectional
  - cannot be intercepted or jammed unless it’s beamed directly at a hostile ship or station
  - if the comm officer doesn’t know exactly where the receiving station is, the laser transceiver is a waste of effort
  - a character cannot use the laser transceiver for a general distress call to all stations in the area
  - A ship can’t receive laser communications unless it is equipped with the transceiver
  - Lasers are limited to the speed of light (8 AU/hour)
  - it can take hours or days to get a response within a system, or even weeks to get a response at interstellar distances
- Radio Transceiver
  - can transmit on multiple frequencies in either LOS (line of sight) or omnidirectional mode
  - sending messages at the speed of light
  - can handle up to ten simultaneous two-way conversations


## Engines

### Thrusters

- can propel a ship through a planetary atmosphere and land it safely on a planetary surface
- serve as secondary engines when primary engines fail or shut down
- must refuel after every battle or every orbital mission
- Thruster fuel has a purchase DC of 31.

### Fusion Torch Engine

- a fusion reactor with one wall of the magnetic bottle missing, directing the thrust in the form of super-heated plasma. 
- intended for space-only applications; its exhaust stream would melt anything it landed on and incinerate everything within a few hundred yards of ground zero.
- expels a tremendous amount of radiation
- uses hydrogen for fuel
- must refuel after every three battles or interplanetary trips
- Tactical Speed Bonus: +500 feet (+1 square).
-  Fusion torch fuel has a purchase DC of 23.
