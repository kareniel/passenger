## Spine

Act 1

1. Once upon a time...
  There was a boy named Sim who missed his mom dearly.

2. Every day...
  He was waiting for the starship to get him home, so he could plant his mom's favorite flower seedlings unto her grave. 

3. Until one day...
  The ship got hit by an asteroid breaking the glass canister containing the seedlings.


Act 2

4. Because of this...
  Sim had to find a way to preserve the plants

5. Because of that...
  He started participating in the ship's operations.

6. and because of that...
  Sim was forced to give up the flower seedlings


Act 3

7. Until finally...
  Sim learned to let go of his sadness

8. Ever since then...
  He pilots his own merchant ship, spreading flowers all accross the galaxy

The moral of the story is... 
  It is not by rituals that you best honor someone you love, but by embodying their best virtues
